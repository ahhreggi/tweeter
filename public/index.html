          They are restricted only by your imagination. Give him some arms -- a tree needs some arms. It's a fantastic day here! This is such a super day!

          That gives us a general idea of how that mountain was made. We use darkness to make those colors stand out! It takes a very, very little bit. You know I'm crazy about water.

          I want a very gentle, quiet little sky. Whatever works is good. Maybe we'll do some almighty mountains today. You do whatever works for you.

          Try not to kill it. Just let it work around and play. Just gonna start any ol' where. You have to sort of plan these clouds.

          You have to make an almighty decision. Just like baking a cake! Wiggle it, then sharpen it. All you're worried about is this nice outside shape.

          We'll put a few little nicety things in there. It helps, when you're doing these kinds of things, make up little stories in your mind. Let's have some big, fluffy clouds in this painting. Very, very... let me say that one more time: very.
